Write a program that uses a hash to store 
a list of movie titles with the year they 
came out. Then use the puts command to make 
your program print out the year of each movie 
to the screen. The output for your program 
should look something like this.

Use the dates from the previous example and store 
them in an array. Then make your program output 
the same thing as exercise 3.
