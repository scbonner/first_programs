=begin
Write a method called foo that takes two parameters a and b and 
prints "hooray" if both are even otherwise it prints "boo!"
Write a method called xyz that takes one parameter x and returns 
an array with the numbers x, x-1, and x-2
Write a method called oct that takes one parameter a that is an 
array of numbers and returns a new array with only the numbers 
from the first array that are divisible by 8
The program should call each of the methods so that you know 
that they work.  Store the program in github when you are done.
